# Honours Thesis Workflow - MINT Research Group

## 1. Repository Management

* **Location:** GitHub `mint-research`.
* **Access:** You will be added as a collaborator to a private repo created for you.
* **Workflow:** Use **Draft Pull Requests** for ongoing work. Only mark as "Ready for Review" when you specifically need my feedback.

## 2. Documentation & Reports

* **OneDrive:** All documents (theses, reports, drafts) are shared via a live OneDrive link.
* **Versioning:** Work on live files; and keep local snapshots for tracking/backup.
* **Feedback:** I will use "Comments" or "Suggestions" mode. Please no attachments in the email.

## 3. Meetings & Progress

* **Frequency:** Weekly or fortnightly, up to your preference. Online or in-person, up to you.
* **Focus:** Discuss **learnings**, **pain points**, and **challenges** rather than just status updates. Failures are valuable data—share them.
* **Milestones:** Set short-term and long-term milestones to safeguard quality and deadlines.

## 4. Communication & Support

* **Standard:** My calendar is up to date. Find a free slot and email me to book a meeting.
* **Inbox Rule:** If I don't reply within 24 hours, please send a follow-up. I appreciate the reminder.
* **Urgent:** Walk to **Room 415, J03 Building** or call via Teams.
* **Help:** If you need help, just let me know. I am here to help you succeed.

## 5. Philosophy

* **Expectation:** Be prepared, be curious, and take ownership of your project.
