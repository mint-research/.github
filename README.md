## 💡 About Us
MINT is a recursive research collective dedicated to developing "fresh" algorithmic solutions. We believe that the best technology should be like mint: crisp, essential, and refreshing.

## 👋 Join Us
We are just getting started. If you are a student or researcher at USYD interested in "salt-of-the-earth" research with a "mint" finish, keep an eye on this space.
