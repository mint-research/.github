# MINT Research Group

### **M**INT **I**ntelligence for **N**ext-generation **T**echnologies

Welcome to the official home of the **MINT Research Group**. Based at the University of Sydney, we focus on the intersection of Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and high-impact application domains.

## 💡 About Us
MINT is a recursive research collective dedicated to developing "fresh" algorithmic solutions. We believe that the best technology should be like mint: crisp, essential, and refreshing.
